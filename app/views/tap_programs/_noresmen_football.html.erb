                                Football requires a lot of practice time. It also requires a commitment to physical fitness, skill development, learning plays and game planning. Youth football will also help a child develop positive work ethic. Developing a strong work ethic will better enable children to achieve their goals later in life.

                                Football is a competitive sport. Playing youth football will encourage competitiveness in other areas of life. Players will have to compete in practice for playing time. Players will compete against other teams on game day. To be successful in life you need to be competitive. Being non-competitive often leads to underachievement, therefore football is good training for later in life..
