     School may be out, but education and adventure are always in at T.A.P.S Summer Enrichment Camp! With 

activities for kindergarten – rising grade 8, there are tons of programs to get kids excited about Academics, Arts and 

Athletics. The club, studio and lab environment encourages experimentation, exploration and discovery geared for 

specific age groups. 

This summer T.A.P.S will be providing a summer to remember for every child in K-8th grade. The children will be 

broken into groups with a 25:2 camper/counselor ratio. Each morning campers will participate in an empowerment 

session and then head out on our artificial turf filed for a group ice breaker. After the ice breaker it’s time for 

Academics! We have hired a host of certified teachers to ensure your children will not lose all their hard work from 

the school year in the areas of Math and Literacy. The campers will be separated according to grade level for an 

hour of Math and reading every day.  After the academic session as according to the club/elective your camper has 

chosen they will rotate into a time of exploration and fun. We have an array of clubs including STEM, ARTS (visual 

and performing dance, music and drama), ATHLETICS, HOME ECONOMICS and more! During lunch campers 

are able to eat , relax and enjoy movies, after lunch campers have free time to play outside or in one of our many 

interactive areas . At the end of the day all campers will come together and have a group activity.  

In the Academic Club lead by a certified teacher Children will engage in STEM as they take part in hands-on 

simulations, workshops, while making new friends and having unforgettable adventures. Exploring STEM is a 

unique learning experience for bright, forward-thinking students who will evolve into our next generation of 

innovators, engineers, doctors, software developers, mathematicians, and physicists. Engineering is all about 

creating, building, and making things better! So what does it take to be an engineer? If you like math and science, 

you are off to a great start. If you enjoy discovering new things, solving problems, and learning how things work - 

even better! Creativity, persistence, and the desire to make the world a better place are also important our summer 

program will be a great start. We have a Math and Technology Lab as well as a Science and Engineering lab

In Athletic Club Children lead by former high school and collegiate athletes the children will participate in their 

favorite sport games and learn fundamentals in sports such as:  dodge ball, capture the flag, kickball, baseball, 

soccer basketball and football. They will also participate in game room tournaments. 

In the ARTS Club lead by undergraduate and art educators who are passionate about art which is designed to seed 

inspiration, foster curiosity, and channel enthusiasm, while turning the wonder of children’s imagination and 

creativity through Art, Drama, Music(lessons available) and Dance.  We are happy to announce we have art, music 

and drama classrooms as well as a dance studio.

T.A.P.S prides itself in our signature Entrepreneurship and Philanthropy program where the children learn about 

branding and money management and open and run their very own in-house store. This was a camp favorite 

amongst the parents and the children last year.

STOP! Is our anti-bullying session where we partner with outside organizations such as CMPD to teach the 

importance of being a champion against bullying.
